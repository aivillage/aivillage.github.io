      <description>Attack detection has been a part of information security for decades. First known examples of IDS implementations date back to the early 80s. Here is what we read about that time on Wikipedia:
 Dorothy E. Denning, assisted by Peter G. Neumann, published a model of an IDS in 1986 that formed the basis for many systems today.[20] Her model used statistics for anomaly detection, and resulted in an early IDS at SRI International named the Intrusion Detection Expert System (IDES), which ran on Sun workstations and could consider both user and network level data</description>

      <description>The AI Village at DEFCON is a place where experts in AI and security (or both!) can come together to learn and discuss the use, and misuse, of artificial intelligence in traditional security. Artificial Learning techniques are rapidly being deployed in core security technologies like malware detection and network traffic analysis, but their use has also opened up a variety of new attack vectors against the systems that use them.</description>

      <description>What the? Curious about what it means to play with GPUs, malware or human trafficking data, random forests, and giant graphs? And know just enough Python to be dangerous? Or, just want to score some easy AI Village CTF points for a few hours, meet some data hackers, and maybe score a badge?
Stop by the Intro to Data Masterclasses for an accessible way to get started with modern data science for security data.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the second post in the AI Village&amp;rsquo;s adversarial machine learning series. This one will cover the greedy fast methods that are most commonly used. We will explain what greedy means and why certain choices were made that may not be obvious to newcomers. This is meant as a read-a-long with the papers, we will not be going into a lot of detail but we will focus on the explaining the tricky minutia so that you can understand these papers more easily.</description>

      <description>With DEF CON just two months away, we&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce two panels that will be held at AI Village this year! Here&amp;rsquo;s what we have planned for attendees so far:
(Responsible?) Offensive Machine Learning Panelists * @_delta_zero (Moderating) * @bodaceacat * @filar * @Straithe
Abstract: Cool evil hacks using machine learning are exploding in popularity. Not all ML abuse looks like Terminators, but also DeepFakes, political impersonation, and distracting autonomous cars.</description>

      <title>Max evil MLsec: why should you care?</title>

      <description>“Max evil” MLsec: why should you care? Originally posted on Medium - follow @sarajayneterp and like her article there
MLsec is the intersection of machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning and information security. It has an active community (see the MLsec project, Defcon’s AI Village and the CAMLIS conference) and a host of applications including the offensive ones outlined in “The Malicious Use of AI”.
One of the things we’ve been talking about is what it means to be ethical in this space.</description>

      <description>Welcome to AI Village’s series on adversarial examples. This will focus on image classification attacks as they are simpler to work with and this series is meant to explain the attacks to hackers who have an interest in data science. The underlying principles are the same for attacks against malware/spam/security classifiers, though the implementation varies. This post focuses on the core reason why adversarial examples work, the high dimensional space our data occupies.</description>

      <description>The AI Village is a community of hackers and data scientists working to educate the world on the use and abuse of artificial intelligence in security and privacy.
We are not sponsored by any one company, and it is our mission to maintain it as such as the community grows.
We have a presence at DEF CON, the world&amp;rsquo;s longest running and largest underground hacking conference.</description>
